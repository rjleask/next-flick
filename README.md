    Node/Express app
    This app attempts to solve a problem...that problem being wasted, lost forever time trying to decide on a movie to watch. It's
    an epidemic. Next flick allows the user to create an account and customize their settings so that the return results are favorable.
    It will eventually be able to choose a movie for you thus removing the deciding horror.
